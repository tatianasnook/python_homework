# Task 3: Write a Program to Extract this Data

# 1. get_books.py. The program should import from selenium and webdriver_manager, as shown in your lesson. 
# You also need pandas and json.

# 2. Add code to load the web page given in task 2.

# 3. Find all the li elements in that page for the search list results.  You use the class values you stored in task 2 step 3. 
# Also use the tag name when you do the find, to make sure you get the right elements.

# 4. Within your program, create an empty list called results. 
# You are going to add dict values to this list, one for each search result.

#5. Main loop: You iterate through the list of li entries.  For each, you find the entry that contains title of the book,
# and get the text for that entry.  Then you find the entries that contain the authors of the book, and get the text for each. 
# If you find more than one author, you want to join the author names with a semicolonbetween each.
# Then you find the div that contains the format and the year, and then you find the span entry within it that contains this information.
# You get that text too.  You now have three pieces of text.  
# Create a dict that stores these values, with the keys being Title, Author, and Format-Year.  
# Then append that dict to your results list.

# 6. Create a DataFrame from this list of dicts.  Print the DataFrame.
